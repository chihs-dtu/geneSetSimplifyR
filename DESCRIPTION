Description: geneSetSimplifyR seeks to simplify gene-set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) via clustering of gene sets.
  Given a list of gene sets of interest the package clusters these using LSI
  and SNN and subsequently the clusters are labelled using TF-IDF to find the 
  best suitable two-word label for each cluster. The package contains several
  plotting functions so the user can quickly visualize the clustering output and
  draw biological meaningful insights.
