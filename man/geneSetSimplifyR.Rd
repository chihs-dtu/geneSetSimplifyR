\title{Run the geneSetSimplifyR workflow}
\usage{
geneSetSimplifyR(
  geneSetsList,
  geneSetsDF = NULL,
  resolution = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1),
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{geneSetsList}{A list containing the gene sets to be analyzed.
The name of each element in the list should be a gene set and each element should contain
the genes belonging to that gene set.}

\item{geneSetsDF}{Optional data.frame with gene sets and enrichment scores that can be usefull
for downstream visualization (both for effect size and direction and if multiple conditions are analyzed).
Should have a column named 'pathway' containing the gene sets and a column
named 'enrichment_score' with the enrichment scores from GSEA analysis for each gene set.
Optinally have a column named 'source' indicating the source of each gene set. This allows for
analysis of multi-condtional data throughput the entire workflow and is also supported by many
plotting functions. See the vignette for more info.}

\item{resolution}{Vector with the desired clustering resolutions to use. Higher number usually results in more clusters.}

\item{verbose}{a logic indicating whether to print progress statements. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
'gsList' object with labelled clusters for all clustered resolutions.
}
\description{
Wrapper function that runs the three core functions of
the 'geneSetSimplifyR' workflow with default parameters.

}
\examples{
gsListObject <- geneSetSimplifyR(geneSetsDF, geneSetsList)
}
